The data for subject sj should be contained in Data(sj) in the format containing
the following fields:


 Data(sj).ID 					subject ID 
 Data(sj).Nch     			number of valid choices by this subject 

 Data(sj).a 					Nchx1 vector of chioces 
                              1 = low rew/low effort, 2 = high rew/high effort
 Data(sj).rew 					Nchx1 vector of rewards for high reward option 
                              (low reward option is always 1) 

 Data(sj).EffortcostLo		effort associated with low effort option 
                              (action 1) - default = -1 (NB: should be negative)
 Data(sj).EffortcostHi		effort associated with action high effort option 
                              (action 2) - default = -0.2 (NB: should be negative)

 Data(sj).decisiontime  	Nchx1 vector times to first button press
 Data(sj).inputtime			Nchx1 vector of durations of input 
                              (last - first button press time)
